TIPS
=====
-BARF! is air unblockable. Set it up with an EX DOWNmobile.
-Lunar Punishment can be cancelled into either grounded Z normal before the hitbox comes out. It can also be used to perform kara throws.
-Gobble gobble etc. can hit airborne enemies, but it still has an absurdly short range.
-I'LL FUCK YA IN THE FACE can be comboed out of.
-KATTO and Real Meaty Double Slap are both great anti-airs. DOWNmobile is also useful.
-The GEP gun takedown is always the most silent way to eliminate Manderley
-EX Blink Dagger has invincibility and comes out faster.
-EX DOWNmobile hits more times, but knocks enemies higher.
-EX HERE'S JOHNNY fires more projectiles, but does a hard knockdown.
-EX RUN deals two hits and launches. It's also jump-cancelable!
-EX Youmu j.2A from Touhou 12.3 combines it with Blink Dagger.
-EX THAT SHIT I JUST TOOK etc etc is basically using both normal versions at once.
-Lunar Punishment is an overhead, as is the second hit of Real Meaty Double Slap
