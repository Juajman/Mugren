-Properties-
=Counters Low, Mid, High attacks
=Counters Normals and Specials, cannot counter Supers
=Active for 15 frames
=Juggleable (EX Only)

= SPECIAL PROPERTIES =
If you counter an attack, you "learn" that specific attack.
You'll know if you "learned" a move by seeing the little swords
on the corner of the screen. If you counter the same move, you don't
add any swords to the counter, but it still works as a basic counter.
If you block a "learned" move, you can press any attack button
during block stun and counter that move with whatever button you pressed.
Khan can only learn up to 20 moves, however its unlikely that you will
be able to counter that many unique moves in a real match.
Once you've "learned" a move, you'll be able to counter it for the rest
of the match, but it's risky since it leaves Khan open for a while.
NOTE: this all does not apply for the EX version.
