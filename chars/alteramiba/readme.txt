BIOGRAPHY:
Amiba was once a minion of the 'great' Raoh/Ken-Oh/whatever. Raoh one day got very hungry.
"Go fetch me a sandwich, Amiba."
After several really unfunny cracks about women making sandwiches in kitchens, Amiba set off to get the ruler some lunch.
But to no avail.
"I'm sorry, Ken-Oh, there isn't a sandwich LEFT in this town!"
Raoh was about to explain that he could easily just make him one, but he thought it would be funnier if he just kicked him in the groin instead.
Amiba rolled around in pain as his ruler walked away in the most badass-yet-somehow-cliche-considering-the-HNK-series way. He saw nothing but red.
Then he woke up one day. All his skills forgotten, but replaced with new ones. His brain must've been scrambled or something. Odd voices were coming out of him. For some reason he kept making dick jokes.
He then named himself 'Alter Amiba', the meaning of this nickname unknown to even himself.
Will Amiba ever be saved?
No, because then he became sane again and got killed by Kenshiro.
